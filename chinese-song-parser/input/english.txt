I heard raindrops falling on the green grass
I heard the bell ringing in the distance
But i didn't hear your voice
Call my name seriously
I didn't understand feelings when I fell in love with you
It's hard to remember when you leave
Why didn't you find that I met you
Is the best thing in life
Maybe I was busy smiling and crying
Busy chasing meteors in the sky
Forgetting for granted
Who is silently guarding the place in the wind and rain
Turns out you are the lucky one I want to keep
It turns out that we were so close to love
That decision for me against the world
The rain that accompanies me
Every scene is yours
Lucky to meet you
But I have lost the right to cry for you
I hope that in the sky I can't see
You spread your wings
Meet your destiny
How lucky she will be
Youth is a bumpy journey
Has the beauty of hindsight
Too late to thank you for giving me courage
So that I can be myself
Maybe I was busy smiling and crying
Busy chasing meteors in the sky
Forgetting for granted
Who is silently guarding the place in the wind and rain
Turns out you are the lucky one I want to keep
It turns out that we were so close to love
That decision for me against the world
He accompanies me in the rain
Every scene is yours
Lucky to meet you
But I have lost the right to cry for you
I hope that in the sky I can't see
You spread your wings
Meet your destiny
How lucky she will be

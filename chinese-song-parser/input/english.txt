People are getting drunk and the night is deeper How close is this moment
Thoughts seem to be shaking, contradictions are deeper
The heart that was once broken makes you stay close today
How much comfort and doubt secretly reborn
I can't help myself but I actually belong
Extremely vulnerable woman
Don't don't don't do it suddenly
Please cherish my heart if you understand me
Continue to love and love this vulnerable woman
Do n’t wait for this moment, please kiss
It ’s true that you are drunk in the long night
No matter what is a doubt, happiness is a lover
I was scared of this life is that you always get close
We know that we have fate to rebuild my faith
The heart that was once broken makes you stay close today
How much comfort and doubt secretly reborn
I can't help myself but I actually belong
Extremely vulnerable woman
Don't don't don't do it suddenly
Please cherish my heart if you understand me
Continue to love and love this vulnerable woman
(It's a hot kiss throughout my life)
It ’s true that you are drunk in the long night
No matter what is a doubt, happiness is a lover
I can't help myself but I actually belong
Extremely vulnerable woman
Don't don't don't do it suddenly
Please cherish my heart if you understand me
Continue to love and love this vulnerable woman
Do n’t wait for this moment, please kiss
It ’s true that you are drunk in the long night
No matter what is a doubt, happiness is a lover

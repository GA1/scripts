Your brows opened so I smiled
Your eyes are red, my sky is gray

Oh god knows 　Since you say 　you are happy, then I am happy
The roses are blooming　what am I thinking
I can’t ask for it, I can’t ask for it.
Joy, anger and sorrow 　 I will repeat your mistakes

Your hair is wet, so I'm hot
You feel tired　 so I slept

God knows 　 don't ask why 　 feel at ease

After the storm, there may not be a beautiful sky
Rainbow is not the sky
So your innocent look does n’t mean you are ignorant
Not all emotions have a beginning and an end
The end of loneliness is not necessarily panic
But life is always inevitable. The first pain
I hope your eyes can only see a smile
I hope every tear you shed will be touching
I hope every future dream will not be empty
If the world is worthy of praise
It's also because of you that you become noisy
The world is hazy than you think
I can't bear to cheat anymore, I hope you understand

I hope you will understand where to go

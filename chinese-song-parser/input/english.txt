Standing alone on this stage, I heard applause
I have infinite emotion in my heart
How much youth is out, how many feelings have changed
I still have your love
It seems like the first stage to hear the first applause
My tears can't help but fall
How many failed
Tell yourself to be patient
Applause sounded, my heart better understood
Your love will be with me
Applause sounded, my heart better understood
Songs meet your love
Standing alone on this stage, I heard applause
I have infinite emotion in my heart
How much youth is out, how many feelings have changed
I still have your love
It seems like the first stage to hear the first applause
My tears can't help but fall
How many failed
Tell yourself to be patient
Applause sounded, my heart better understood
Your love will be with me
Applause sounded, my heart better understood
Songs meet your love
Applause sounded, my heart better understood
Your love will be with me
Applause sounded, my heart better understood
Songs meet your love

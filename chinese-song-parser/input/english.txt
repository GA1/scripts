Don't talk about separation
I won't cry because of this
That was just a dream last night
Don't say yes or not
I don't care because of this
That was just a game last night
It's just a game and a dream
Although your shadow still appears in my eyes
You are no longer in my singing
It's just a game and a dream
Don't leave the broken love here
There shouldn't be you in the world of two people
oh why did you say goodbye to you and what to say together
Even without you, I am still myself
What do you say this love will never heal
Say what i love you
I still don't have you, I'm still myself
It's just a game and a dream
Although your shadow still appears in my eyes
You are no longer in my singing
It's just a game and a dream
Don't leave the broken love here
There shouldn't be you in the world of two people
oh why did you say goodbye to you and what to say together
Even without you, I am still myself
What do you say this love will never heal
Say what i love you
I still don’t have you, I’m still myself
Why did you say goodbye to each other?
Even without you, I am still myself
What do you say this love will never heal
Say what i love you
I still don’t have you, I’m still myself

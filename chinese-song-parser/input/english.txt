Who is knocking on my window
Who is strumming the strings
That forgotten time
Gradually rising back out of my heart
Who is knocking on my window
Who is strumming the strings
The joyful scene in memory
Slowly come to my mind
The slowly falling rain
Keep hitting my window
Only me who is silent
Think back to the past
Who is knocking on my window
Who is strumming the strings
The joyful scene in memory
Slowly come to my mind
The slowly falling rain
Keep hitting my window
Only me who is silent
Think back to the past
Who is knocking on my window
Who is strumming the strings
The joyful scene in memory
Slowly come to my mind
The joyful scene in memory
Slowly come to my mind

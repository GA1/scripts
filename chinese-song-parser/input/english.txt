Keep your kisses overnight
Can't feel how real you are
Miss you the sky is dusk
Tears on his face
If you never ask
I don't want to leave you alone
Whether it won't be cold at night
My heart won't hurt
Shaking lips can't wait for your kiss
An easily injured woman
Hope hope i hope you will be distressed
I'm afraid of being alone
Why won't you call me gently
Comforting vulnerable women
For you, I would rather give a lifetime
Dare to light up in the dark
Who made me fall deeper and deeper
People I have loved more and more strange
Keep your kisses overnight
Can't feel how real you are
Miss you the sky is dusk
Tears on his face
If you never ask
I don't want to leave you alone
Whether it won't be cold at night
My heart won't hurt
Shaking lips can't wait for your kiss
An easily injured woman
Hope hope i hope you will be distressed
I'm afraid of being alone
Why won't you call me gently
Comforting vulnerable women
Your eyes burn my youth
Dare to light up in the dark
Who made me fall deeper and deeper
People I have loved more and more strange
Shaking lips can't wait for your kiss
An easily injured woman
Hope hope i hope you will be distressed
I'm afraid of being alone
Why won't you call me gently
Comforting vulnerable women
For you, I would rather give a lifetime
Dare to light up in the dark
Who made me fall deeper and deeper
People I have loved more and more strange

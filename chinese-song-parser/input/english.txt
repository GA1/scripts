It hurts my back, I do nâ€™t care
When love has become soot
Finally left in embarrassment
Sleeping alone, only being alone
Dreaming back at midnight alone
Left alone intoxicated
Did you really forget
You said you wanted to have a family
What are you doing now?
Whether you only have one in your heart
If he is not here do you still love me
I really want to know your truth
A word, but I care about it
Love and not love are both answers
If he is not here do you still love me
I really care about your answer
Please don't let my tears rain down
Struggling on the edge of love and pain
Sleeping alone, only being alone
Dreaming back at midnight alone
Left alone intoxicated
Did you really forget
You said you wanted to have a family
What are you doing now?
Whether you only have one in your heart
If he is not here do you still love me
I really want to know your truth
A word, but I care about it
Love and not love are both answers
If he is not here do you still love me
I really care about your answer
Please don't let my tears rain down
Struggling on the edge of love and pain
If he is not here do you still love me
I really want to know your truth
A word, but I care about it
Love and not love are both answers
If he is not here do you still love me
I really care about your answer
Please don't let my tears rain down
Struggling on the edge of love and pain

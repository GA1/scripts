why do i cry for you
don't you understand it's for love
Only the lover's tears are the most precious
every tear is love is love
why do i cry for you
don't you understand it's for love
If it wasn't for a lover who wanted to separate from me
My tears won't fall down
Good spring is coming, spring flowers are blooming
how dare you say goodbye
I'm in the boudoir looking forward to the autumn water
Don't forget that my love is as deep as the sea
why do i cry for you
don't you understand it's for love
If it wasn't for a lover who wanted to separate from me
My tears won't fall down
Good spring is coming, spring flowers are blooming
I'm in the boudoir looking forward to the autumn water
Don't forget that my love is as deep as the sea
why do i cry for you
don't you understand it's for love
If it wasn't for a lover who wanted to separate from me
My tears won't fall, fall

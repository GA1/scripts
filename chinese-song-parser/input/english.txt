If i didn't meet you
Where will i be
How is life going
Whether to cherish life
Maybe know someone
Live an ordinary day
Don't know if it will
There is also love as sweet as honey
Let time go in a hurry
I only care about you
Willing to infect your breath
Life geometry can get a confidant
It's a pity to lose the power of life
So i beg you
Don't let me leave you
except you
I can't feel a touch of affection
If one day
You said you were leaving
I will lose myself
Walk into the sea of boundless people
No promises
As long as we are together
I can't just rely on
Pieces of memories to live
Let time go in a hurry
I only care about you
Willing to infect your breath
Life geometry can get a confidant
It's a pity to lose the power of life
So i beg you
Don't let me leave you
except you
I can't feel a touch of affection
Let time go in a hurry
I only care about you
Willing to infect your breath
Life geometry can get a confidant
It's a pity to lose the power of life
So i beg you
Don't let me leave you
except you
I can't feel a touch of affection

Your eyebrows arched
So I laughed
Your eyes reddened
My sky turned grey

Ah..heaven knows
People say
If you're happy, then I'm happy too
Roses are blooming
What more could I want
Something out of reach, out of reach
Heaven and earthly creations alike are hard to come by
Now sorrows then joys
I’ve fallen again into your world

Your hair was dripping
I became feverish
You were feeling tired
So I fell asleep

Ah..heaven knows
People say
If you're happy, then I'm happy too
Roses are blooming
What else could I want
Something out of reach, out of reach
Heaven and earthly creations alike are hard to come by
Now sorrows then joys
I’ve fallen again into your world

LA LA LA LA
LA LA LA LA

Don’t ask why
I feel so peaceful inside

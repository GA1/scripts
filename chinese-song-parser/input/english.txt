When the train drove into this strange city
That's a neon never seen
The letter you sent me when I opened the farewell
Suddenly feel very miss
Winter city that never sees snow
I heard someone cheering and someone crying
Get used to the dark night full of temptation
But can't forget your face
Has anyone ever told you that I love you very much
Has anyone ever cried in your diary
Has anyone told you that I care
Care about the distance of the city
When the train drove into this strange city
That's a neon never seen
The letter you sent me when I opened the farewell
Suddenly feel very miss
Winter city that never sees snow
I heard someone cheering and someone crying
Get used to the dark night full of temptation
But can't forget your face
Has anyone ever told you that I love you very much
Has anyone ever cried in your diary
Has anyone told you that I care
Care about the distance of the city
Has anyone ever told you that I love you very much
Has anyone ever cried in your diary
Has anyone told you that I care
Care about the distance of the city

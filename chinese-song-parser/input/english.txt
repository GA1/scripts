I often blame myself
Often regret not leaving you behind
Why do you fall in love with each other?
Whether we always wander outside the door
Who knows to be with you again
Destiny is so arranged, it is always helpless
It ’s not bad these years, it ’s just that there is one less person
And I gradually realized that you are still my constant care
How much love can come back How many people are willing to wait
When I understand how to cherish and come back later, I do n’t know if that love will still be there
How much love can come back, how many people are worth waiting for
When love is over, if there is still courage to love
Who knows to be with you again
Destiny is so arranged, it is always helpless
It ’s not bad these years, it ’s just that there is one less person
And I gradually realized that you are still my constant care
How much love can come back How many people are willing to wait
When I understand how to cherish and come back later, I do n’t know if that love will still be there
How much love can come back, how many people are worth waiting for
When love is over, if there is still courage to love
How much love can come back How many people are willing to wait
When I understand how to cherish and come back later, I do n’t know if that love will still be there
How much love can come back, how many people are worth waiting for
When love is over, if there is still courage to love

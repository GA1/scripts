Girl why are you
Wandering alone on the beach
Girl is not afraid
The sea is about to start
Ah not the waves
It's my beautiful clothes
Even though there is black mist in the sky
Fly like that seagull
Girl how i am
Hope around you
Girl and you go to see the sea
Go see the storm
Ah not the waves
It's my beautiful clothes
Even though there is black mist in the sky
Fly like that seagull
Girl how i am
Hope around you
Girl and you go to see the sea
Go see the storm

I will set off at the dawn of late autumn
With the shaking of the iron car
With the fragrance of wild chrysanthemums
Set off at dawn
Goodbye youth
Goodbye beautiful pain
Goodbye youth
Eternal confusion
Rain will slip from the fingers of memory
With the blue bird dancing in the blood
With a straw hat mourning in the wind
Slip from the burning wind
Goodbye youth
Goodbye beautiful pain
Goodbye youth
Hometown forever
Goodbye youth
Goodbye brilliant sorrow
Goodbye youth
Eternal confusion
I once sunk with the lost ship
Broken dreams into the shining void
Sinking into a deep valley
Sinking with the constellation of stars
I watched the bustling city
Feeling painful melancholy
Listen to the loud noise of the heart bursting
Into deep sorrow
Goodbye youth
Goodbye beautiful pain
Goodbye youth
Hometown forever
Goodbye youth
Goodbye brilliant sorrow
Goodbye youth
Eternal confusion

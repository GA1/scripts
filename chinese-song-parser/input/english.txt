Give you a past CD
Listen to our love at that time
Sometimes I suddenly forget that I still love you
I can't sing that kind of song again
When I hear it, I will blush and avoid
I will always forget that I still love you
Because of love, I do n’t feel sad easily.
So everything is happy
Because of love, simple growth
Can still be crazy for you at any time
Because of love, how can there be vicissitudes
So we are still young
Because of love in that place
There are still people wandering there
I can't sing that kind of song again
When I hear it, I will blush and avoid
I will always forget that I still love you
Because of love, I do n’t feel sad easily.
So everything is happy
Because of love, simple growth
Can still be crazy for you at any time
Because of love, how can there be vicissitudes
So we are still young
Because of love in that place
There are still people wandering there
Give you a past CD
Listen to our love at that time
Sometimes I suddenly forget that I still love you
